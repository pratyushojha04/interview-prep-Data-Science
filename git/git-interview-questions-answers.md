Here are GIT interview questions and answers starting from number 1:

---

**1. What is GIT and why is it used?**

**Answer:**  
GIT is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, manage version history, and collaborate efficiently. GIT is used for:
- **Tracking changes:** Keeps a history of changes made to files.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project without interfering with each other’s work.
- **Branching and merging:** Facilitates parallel development by allowing the creation of branches that can later be merged.
- **Backup:** GIT repositories act as a backup for the codebase.

---

**2. What are the basic GIT commands and their functions?**

**Answer:**  
Some of the basic GIT commands include:
- **`git init`:** Initializes a new GIT repository.
- **`git clone`:** Copies an existing repository to your local machine.
- **`git add`:** Stages changes for the next commit.
- **`git commit`:** Commits the staged changes to the repository.
- **`git status`:** Shows the working directory status, including staged, unstaged, and untracked files.
- **`git push`:** Pushes local commits to a remote repository.
- **`git pull`:** Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
- **`git branch`:** Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
- **`git merge`:** Merges changes from one branch into another.

---

**3. What is a GIT repository?**

**Answer:**  
A GIT repository is a storage location where GIT tracks changes to files and directories. It contains all the project files, along with a history of all changes made to those files. Repositories can be either:
- **Local:** Located on a developer's machine.
- **Remote:** Hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and accessible by multiple users.

---

**4. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**

**Answer:**  
- **`git pull`:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into your local branch. It's a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`.
- **`git fetch`:** Only downloads changes from the remote repository but does not merge them. It allows you to review changes before merging.

**Example:**
```bash
# Fetch remote changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Merge the fetched changes
git merge origin/main
```

---

**5. What is branching in GIT, and why is it important?**

**Answer:**  
Branching in GIT allows you to create separate copies of your codebase to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments independently. It’s important because:
- **Parallel Development:** Developers can work on different features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
- **Version Control:** Different versions of the project can be maintained, tested, and reviewed independently.
- **Isolation:** Branches isolate changes until they are ready to be merged into the main branch.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-xyz

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature-xyz
```

---

**6. How do you resolve merge conflicts in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
Merge conflicts occur when GIT is unable to automatically resolve differences between two branches. To resolve conflicts:
1. **Identify the conflict:** GIT will mark the conflicting sections in the files.
2. **Manually resolve the conflict:** Edit the files to reconcile the differences.
3. **Mark as resolved:** Once resolved, mark the files as resolved using `git add`.
4. **Commit the changes:** Commit the resolved files.

**Example:**
```bash
# After resolving conflicts in the files
git add conflicted-file.txt

# Commit the resolved conflict
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

---

**7. What is the `git rebase` command, and when would you use it?**

**Answer:**  
The `git rebase` command is used to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It is typically used to:
- **Clean up commit history:** Make the commit history linear and easier to understand.
- **Update a feature branch:** Move a feature branch to the tip of the main branch for integration.
  
**Example:**
```bash
# Rebase your branch onto the main branch
git checkout feature-xyz
git rebase main
```
Rebasing rewrites commit history, so it’s important to use it carefully, especially with shared branches.

---

**8. What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?**

**Answer:**  
- **`git merge`:** Combines the changes from two branches by creating a new merge commit. It preserves the history of both branches, showing when the branches were merged.
- **`git rebase`:** Moves or applies commits from one branch onto another base commit, resulting in a linear commit history without merge commits.

**Example of Merge:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-xyz
```

**Example of Rebase:**
```bash
git checkout feature-xyz
git rebase main
```

Use `git rebase` for a cleaner history, and `git merge` to preserve the history of how branches were integrated.

---

**9. How can you revert a commit in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
You can revert a commit in GIT using the `git revert` command, which creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.

**Example:**
```bash
# Revert the last commit
git revert HEAD

# Revert a specific commit by its hash
git revert abc1234
```
Reverting is safe because it doesn’t change the commit history but instead adds a new commit that undoes the changes.

---

**10. What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?**

**Answer:**  
The `.gitignore` file specifies which files or directories GIT should ignore and not track in the repository. This is useful for:
- **Excluding temporary files:** Like build artifacts, logs, or system files.
- **Keeping secrets out:** Such as environment files with sensitive information.

**Example of `.gitignore`:**
```plaintext
# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/

# Ignore all .log files
*.log

# Ignore specific files
secrets.env
```
By using `.gitignore`, you can ensure that unnecessary or sensitive files are not included in your GIT history.

Here are more GIT interview questions and answers, starting from number 11:

---

**11. What is a `git stash` and when would you use it?**

**Answer:**  
The `git stash` command is used to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed. This allows you to switch branches or pull updates without losing your current work. Stashed changes can be reapplied later.

**Example:**
```bash
# Stash your changes
git stash

# List stashed changes
git stash list

# Apply the last stashed changes
git stash apply

# Apply and remove the last stash
git stash pop
```
You would use `git stash` when you need to save your work-in-progress changes without committing them and switch to another branch or pull updates.

---

**12. How do you delete a branch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
You can delete a branch in GIT using the `git branch -d` or `git branch -D` commands.

**Example:**
```bash
# Delete a local branch
git branch -d feature-xyz

# Force delete a local branch
git branch -D feature-xyz
```

**Remote branch:**
```bash
# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete feature-xyz
```
Use `-d` for safe deletion (only deletes if the branch is fully merged), and `-D` for force deletion.

---

**13. What is a `bare` repository in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
A bare repository is a GIT repository that doesn’t have a working directory. It only contains the GIT version control data and is used as a central repository for sharing code. Bare repositories are typically used on servers.

**Example:**
```bash
# Initialize a bare repository
git init --bare project.git
```
Developers clone from or push to the bare repository, but they don’t work directly in it.

---

**14. How do you undo the last commit in GIT without losing the changes?**

**Answer:**  
To undo the last commit without losing the changes, use the `git reset` command with the `--soft` option.

**Example:**
```bash
# Undo the last commit, keeping changes in the staging area
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
This will uncommit the last commit, leaving the changes staged for the next commit.

---

**15. What is the difference between `git reset`, `git checkout`, and `git revert`?**

**Answer:**  
- **`git reset`:** Moves the current branch to a specified commit, optionally changing the staging area and working directory. It’s often used to undo commits.
- **`git checkout`:** Switches branches or restores files to a specific state. It doesn’t affect commit history.
- **`git revert`:** Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit, keeping the history intact.

**Example of `git reset`:**
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Example of `git checkout`:**
```bash
git checkout feature-xyz
```

**Example of `git revert`:**
```bash
git revert abc1234
```

Use `git reset` for powerful but potentially destructive changes, `git checkout` for switching branches or files, and `git revert` for safely undoing commits.

---

**16. How do you squash commits in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
Squashing commits means combining multiple commits into one. This is typically done during a rebase.

**Example:**
```bash
# Start an interactive rebase for the last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

In the interactive rebase editor:
- Mark the first commit as `pick`.
- Mark the other commits as `squash` or `s`.
- Save and close the editor.

This will combine the selected commits into a single commit, allowing you to clean up the commit history.

---

**17. What is the purpose of the `git cherry-pick` command?**

**Answer:**  
The `git cherry-pick` command is used to apply the changes from a specific commit to another branch, without merging the entire branch.

**Example:**
```bash
# Apply changes from a specific commit to the current branch
git cherry-pick abc1234
```
You would use `git cherry-pick` to selectively apply bug fixes or features from one branch to another.

---

**18. How can you find a specific commit in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
You can find a specific commit in GIT using the `git log` command with various options or by searching through the commit history.

**Example:**
```bash
# Show the commit history
git log

# Search for a commit by message
git log --grep="Fix bug"

# Search for a commit by author
git log --author="John Doe"

# Show a specific commit by hash
git show abc1234
```
Using these commands, you can easily locate commits based on different criteria.

---

**19. How do you rebase a branch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
Rebasing a branch means moving its commits to the top of another branch, effectively replaying the changes.

**Example:**
```bash
# Rebase the current branch onto main
git rebase main
```
During the rebase process, you may need to resolve conflicts. After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase with:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

Use rebase to keep a linear commit history and to bring your branch up to date with the base branch.

---

**20. How do you rename a branch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To rename a branch in GIT, use the `git branch -m` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Rename the current branch
git branch -m new-branch-name

# Rename a specific branch
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
```
If you want to rename a remote branch, you need to push the renamed branch and delete the old branch on the remote:

```bash
# Push the renamed branch
git push origin new-branch-name

# Delete the old branch
git push origin --delete old-branch-name
```

Renaming a branch helps to keep branch names relevant and descriptive.

Here are more GIT interview questions and answers, starting from number 21:

---

**21. How can you check for changes between commits in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To check for changes between commits, you can use the `git diff` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Compare two specific commits
git diff commit1 commit2

# Compare the working directory with the last commit
git diff HEAD

# Compare the staging area with the last commit
git diff --cached
```
This command will show the differences in files, line by line, between the specified commits or states.

---

**22. What does the `git blame` command do?**

**Answer:**  
The `git blame` command is used to track changes in a file, line by line, to see who made which changes.

**Example:**
```bash
# Show who made each change in a file
git blame filename
```
This command is helpful when you need to identify the author of a specific line or change in a file.

---

**23. How do you resolve a merge conflict in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To resolve a merge conflict, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the conflict:** GIT will mark the conflicting files with conflict markers (e.g., `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
2. **Manually resolve the conflict:** Edit the files to combine the changes as needed.
3. **Mark the conflict as resolved:**
   ```bash
   git add resolved-file
   ```
4. **Complete the merge:**
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```
Alternatively, you can use a merge tool to assist with resolving conflicts.

---

**24. What is `git submodule`, and how do you use it?**

**Answer:**  
A `git submodule` is a repository embedded inside another repository. It allows you to keep another GIT repository as a subdirectory in your project.

**Example:**
```bash
# Add a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git path/to/submodule

# Initialize submodules after cloning
git submodule update --init

# Update submodules
git submodule update --remote
```
Submodules are useful when your project depends on external projects that you want to manage separately.

---

**25. How do you create and apply a patch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To create a patch, use the `git format-patch` command, and to apply a patch, use the `git apply` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a patch from the last commit
git format-patch -1 HEAD

# Apply a patch
git apply patch-file.patch
```
Patches are helpful for sharing specific changes without sharing the entire repository history.

---

**26. What is `git bisect`, and how do you use it?**

**Answer:**  
`git bisect` is a tool for finding the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through the commit history.

**Example:**
```bash
# Start the bisect process
git bisect start

# Mark the current commit as bad
git bisect bad

# Mark an earlier known good commit
git bisect good commit-hash

# GIT automatically checks out commits; test them and mark as good or bad
git bisect good
git bisect bad

# Once the bad commit is found, end the bisect process
git bisect reset
```
This command is useful for efficiently locating the exact commit that introduced a bug.

---

**27. How do you clone a GIT repository with submodules?**

**Answer:**  
To clone a GIT repository with submodules, you need to use the `--recurse-submodules` flag.

**Example:**
```bash
# Clone a repository with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
This command ensures that submodules are initialized and cloned along with the main repository.

---

**28. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**

**Answer:**  
- **`git fetch`:** Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your working directory. It updates your local copy of the remote branch.
- **`git pull`:** Combines `git fetch` with `git merge`, automatically fetching and merging the changes into your current branch.

**Example of `git fetch`:**
```bash
git fetch origin
```

**Example of `git pull`:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

Use `git fetch` when you want to review changes before merging, and `git pull` for a direct update.

---

**29. How do you find a file that was deleted in a GIT repository?**

**Answer:**  
To find a deleted file in a GIT repository, you can use the `git log` command with the `--diff-filter=D` option.

**Example:**
```bash
# Show commits where files were deleted
git log --diff-filter=D --summary

# Restore the deleted file
git checkout commit-hash -- path/to/file
```
This command helps track down when and where a file was deleted and allows you to restore it.

---

**30. How can you ignore files in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
You can ignore files in GIT by creating a `.gitignore` file and listing the files or patterns you want to ignore.

**Example:**
```bash
# .gitignore file content
node_modules/
*.log
.env
```
The `.gitignore` file tells GIT to ignore these files and directories, preventing them from being tracked in the repository.

Here are more GIT interview questions and answers, starting from number 31:

---

**31. What is a GIT hook, and how do you use it?**

**Answer:**  
GIT hooks are scripts that run automatically on certain events in a GIT repository, such as before or after commits, merges, or pushes. They allow you to customize and automate GIT workflows.

**Example:**
- **Pre-commit Hook:** Runs before a commit is made. Useful for checking code style, running tests, etc.
  ```bash
  # .git/hooks/pre-commit
  #!/bin/sh
  npm test || exit 1
  ```

- **Post-commit Hook:** Runs after a commit is made. Useful for notifications or updating documentation.
  ```bash
  # .git/hooks/post-commit
  #!/bin/sh
  echo "Commit successful!"
  ```

Hooks are stored in the `.git/hooks/` directory and are local to your repository.

---

**32. How do you track changes in a binary file with GIT?**

**Answer:**  
By default, GIT handles binary files as a single unit and does not track line-by-line changes. However, you can track versions of binary files and manage them using GIT like any other file.

**Example:**
```bash
# Track a binary file
git add file.bin

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Added binary file"
```

For more advanced binary file handling, you may need external tools or configure GIT to use custom diff tools for binary files.

---

**33. What is the `git stash` command used for?**

**Answer:**  
The `git stash` command temporarily saves your changes that are not ready to be committed. This allows you to switch branches or work on something else without committing the unfinished work.

**Example:**
```bash
# Stash your current changes
git stash

# Apply the stashed changes later
git stash apply

# Apply and remove the stash
git stash pop

# List all stashes
git stash list
```

Stashing is useful when you need to save your work quickly without committing.

---

**34. How do you delete a remote branch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To delete a remote branch, use the `git push` command with the `--delete` option.

**Example:**
```bash
# Delete a remote branch named 'feature-branch'
git push origin --delete feature-branch
```

Deleting a remote branch removes it from the remote repository, but local copies of the branch remain unaffected.

---

**35. What does the `git cherry-pick` command do?**

**Answer:**  
The `git cherry-pick` command applies the changes from a specific commit (or commits) onto your current branch.

**Example:**
```bash
# Cherry-pick a specific commit
git cherry-pick commit-hash

# Cherry-pick multiple commits
git cherry-pick commit1 commit2 commit3
```

This command is useful when you want to apply a particular change from another branch without merging the entire branch.

---

**36. What is a `detached HEAD` state in GIT, and how do you resolve it?**

**Answer:**  
A `detached HEAD` state occurs when you checkout a specific commit instead of a branch, meaning you are not on a branch and any commits you make do not belong to any branch.

**Example:**
```bash
# Checkout a specific commit (detached HEAD state)
git checkout commit-hash
```

**To resolve it:**
- **Create a new branch:**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-branch
  ```
- **Switch back to a branch:**
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  ```

---

**37. How do you rebase a branch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
Rebasing re-applies commits from one branch on top of another. It’s useful for maintaining a linear project history.

**Example:**
```bash
# Rebase the feature branch onto the main branch
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

**Interactive Rebase:**
```bash
# Start an interactive rebase
git rebase -i main
```

Interactive rebasing allows you to edit, squash, or reorder commits during the rebase process.

---

**38. How do you resolve conflicts during a rebase?**

**Answer:**  
If conflicts occur during a rebase, GIT pauses and allows you to resolve them manually.

**Steps to resolve conflicts:**
1. **Identify and resolve conflicts:** Edit the conflicting files.
2. **Mark conflicts as resolved:**
   ```bash
   git add resolved-file
   ```
3. **Continue the rebase:**
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

If you decide to abort the rebase:
```bash
git rebase --abort
```

---

**39. How do you undo the last commit in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To undo the last commit, you can use either `git reset` or `git revert`.

**Option 1: Using `git reset`** (removes the commit and unstages changes):
```bash
# Undo the last commit but keep the changes
git reset HEAD~1
```

**Option 2: Using `git revert`** (creates a new commit that undoes the changes):
```bash
# Revert the last commit
git revert HEAD
```

---

**40. What is a `bare repository` in GIT, and how is it used?**

**Answer:**  
A `bare repository` is a GIT repository that does not have a working directory. It only contains the version control information, making it suitable for use as a remote repository.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a bare repository
git init --bare repo.git
```

Bare repositories are typically used as central repositories where developers push and pull changes without direct working directory access.

---

Let me know if you need more questions or further assistance!

Here are more GIT interview questions and answers, starting from number 41:

---

**41. How do you rename a local branch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
You can rename a local branch using the `git branch -m` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Rename the current branch
git branch -m new-branch-name

# Rename a specific branch
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

This changes the branch name locally. If the branch has been pushed to a remote repository, you’ll need to delete the old branch and push the new one.

---

**42. How do you revert a file to a previous commit in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To revert a file to a previous state from a specific commit, use the `git checkout` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Revert a specific file to the state from a particular commit
git checkout commit-hash -- path/to/file
```

This reverts the file to the specified commit's state, but does not create a new commit unless you commit the changes.

---

**43. What does the `git describe` command do?**

**Answer:**  
The `git describe` command provides a human-readable identifier for a commit by using the closest annotated tag in the commit history.

**Example:**
```bash
# Describe the current commit
git describe
```

The output might look something like `v1.2.3-14-gabcd123`, where `v1.2.3` is the closest tag, `14` is the number of commits since that tag, and `gabcd123` is the abbreviated commit hash.

---

**44. How do you list all tags in a GIT repository?**

**Answer:**  
To list all tags in a GIT repository, use the `git tag` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# List all tags
git tag

# List tags that match a pattern
git tag -l "v1.2.*"
```

Tags are often used to mark release points (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.0`).

---

**45. How do you merge a specific commit into your current branch?**

**Answer:**  
To merge a specific commit into your current branch, you can use the `git cherry-pick` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Cherry-pick a specific commit onto the current branch
git cherry-pick commit-hash
```

This command applies the changes from the specific commit to your current branch as a new commit.

---

**46. How do you create and apply a patch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
A patch in GIT is a file that contains changes that can be applied to a repository. You can create a patch using the `git format-patch` command and apply it using `git apply`.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a patch file for the last commit
git format-patch -1 HEAD

# Apply a patch file
git apply path/to/patch.patch
```

Patches are useful for sharing changes between repositories without using a remote.

---

**47. How do you view the commit history for a specific file in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To view the commit history for a specific file, use the `git log` command with the file path.

**Example:**
```bash
# View the commit history for a specific file
git log path/to/file
```

This will show all commits that affected the specified file, including changes and commit messages.

---

**48. What is the purpose of the `git reflog` command?**

**Answer:**  
The `git reflog` command is used to record updates to the tip of branches and other references in the local repository. It allows you to recover from many common mistakes by providing a history of actions.

**Example:**
```bash
# View the reflog for the current branch
git reflog
```

Reflog entries can be used to recover lost commits, reset branches, and more.

---

**49. How do you reset a file to its state in the last commit?**

**Answer:**  
To reset a file to its state in the last commit, use the `git checkout` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Reset a specific file to its last committed state
git checkout -- path/to/file
```

This discards all changes made to the file since the last commit.

---

**50. How do you configure GIT to handle line endings correctly on different operating systems?**

**Answer:**  
GIT can be configured to handle line endings automatically using the `core.autocrlf` setting.

**Options:**
- **On Windows:** Convert LF to CRLF on checkout, and CRLF to LF on commit.
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf true
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux:** Convert CRLF to LF on checkout and commit.
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  ```

- **Disable conversion:** No automatic conversion of line endings.
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf false
  ```

This helps prevent issues with inconsistent line endings when collaborating across different operating systems.

---

**51. What is `git bisect`, and how does it work?**

**Answer:**  
`git bisect` is a tool used to find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through the commit history.

**Example:**
```bash
# Start the bisect process
git bisect start

# Mark the current commit as bad (containing the bug)
git bisect bad

# Mark an earlier commit as good (without the bug)
git bisect good commit-hash

# GIT automatically checks out a commit for testing
# If the commit is bad, run:
git bisect bad

# If the commit is good, run:
git bisect good
```

The process continues until the offending commit is found. Afterward, run `git bisect reset` to end the bisect session.

---

**52. How do you remove a file from GIT without deleting it from your local file system?**

**Answer:**  
To remove a file from GIT but keep it on your local file system, use the `git rm --cached` command.

**Example:**
```bash
# Remove a file from the repository but keep it locally
git rm --cached path/to/file

# Commit the change
git commit -m "Remove file from repository"
```

This command stages the file for removal from the repository while leaving the file intact in your local working directory.

---

**53. What is a “detached HEAD” state in GIT, and how can you get out of it?**

**Answer:**  
A “detached HEAD” state occurs when the HEAD is pointing to a specific commit instead of a branch. This means you're not on any branch and any commits made in this state will not be associated with any branch.

**To get out of a detached HEAD state:**
1. **Switch to an existing branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```

2. **Create a new branch from the detached HEAD:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```

Committing changes on this new branch will keep them safe.

---

**54. What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?**

**Answer:**  
- **`git fetch`:** Downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repository. It does not merge these changes into your current branch.
- **`git pull`:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and immediately tries to merge them into the current branch.

**Example:**
```bash
# Fetch changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Fetch changes and merge them
git pull origin main
```

Use `git fetch` when you want to review the changes before merging.

---

**55. How do you delete a remote branch in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
To delete a remote branch, use the `git push` command with the `--delete` option.

**Example:**
```bash
# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

This command removes the branch from the remote repository, but the local branch will still exist unless you delete it with `git branch -d branch-name`.

**56. What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?**

**Answer:**  
The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that GIT should ignore (not track). It is commonly used to prevent committing temporary files, build artifacts, sensitive information, etc.

**Example:**
```plaintext
# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore environment files
.env
```

Adding a `.gitignore` file ensures that these files are not accidentally added to the repository.

**57. How do you resolve conflicts in GIT after a merge?**

**Answer:**  
When GIT detects conflicting changes during a merge, it will pause the merge process and mark the files with conflicts. You can resolve conflicts by manually editing the conflicted files.

**Steps to resolve conflicts:**
1. Open the conflicted files in an editor.
2. Look for conflict markers:
   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your changes
   =======
   Incoming changes
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```
3. Edit the file to resolve the conflict.
4. Stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add path/to/file
   ```
5. Complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```

**58. What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?**

**Answer:**  
- **`git merge`:** Combines two branches into one by creating a new merge commit, keeping the history of both branches intact.
- **`git rebase`:** Moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It rewrites the commit history, making it appear as though the branch started from a different commit.

**Example:**
```bash
# Merge branch-name into the current branch
git merge branch-name

# Rebase the current branch onto branch-name
git rebase branch-name
```

Use `git rebase` for a linear history and `git merge` when you want to preserve all branch history.

**59. How do you squash commits in GIT?**

**Answer:**  
Squashing commits combines multiple commits into a single commit. This is typically done during a rebase.

**Example:**
```bash
# Start an interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~n

# Mark commits to be squashed
# Change "pick" to "squash" (or "s") for the commits you want to squash
```

Squashing is useful for cleaning up commit history before merging a feature branch.

**60. How do you track files in GIT LFS (Large File Storage)?**

**Answer:**  
GIT LFS is used to manage large files in a GIT repository. To track a file with GIT LFS:

**Steps:**
1. **Install GIT LFS (if not installed):**
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. **Track a specific file type:**
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.psd"
   ```

3. **Commit the `.gitattributes` file:**
   ```bash
   git add .gitattributes
   git commit -m "Track PSD files with GIT LFS"
   ```

Files tracked by GIT LFS will be stored on a separate server, keeping the repository size manageable.
