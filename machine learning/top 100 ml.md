# Machine Learning Interview Questions

This repository contains a list of machine learning practical coding questions and detailed answers to help with interview preparation. The questions cover a range of core concepts in machine learning.

## Questions and Answers

### 1. Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Details:**
- **Bias**: Error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. High bias indicates underfitting, where the model is too simplistic and fails to capture the underlying pattern.
- **Variance**: Error introduced by sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. High variance indicates overfitting, where the model captures noise rather than the underlying pattern.
- **Tradeoff**: Increasing model complexity reduces bias but increases variance. Conversely, simpler models have higher bias and lower variance. The goal is to balance bias and variance to achieve good generalization.

### 2. What is Cross-Validation and Why is it Important?

**Details:**
- **Cross-Validation**: A technique to assess how the results of a statistical analysis generalize to an independent dataset. It helps to avoid overfitting and ensures the model's robustness.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: The dataset is divided into \(k\) subsets. The model is trained on \(k-1\) folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated \(k\) times, with each fold used as a test set exactly once. The performance metric is the average of all folds.

### 3. How Does a Decision Tree Work?

**Details:**
- **Decision Tree**: A model that splits data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure with decision and leaf nodes.
